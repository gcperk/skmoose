# skmoose

<!-- badges: start -->

Skmoose package is a series of steps to estimate moose quality within survey blocks. This package was written for the Skeena regional Moose survey group under Ministry of Water, Lands, Resources and XXXXXX. 

Where possible all data used in the process is extracted from the BC data catalogue, using the bcdata and bcmaps packages. These ensure up to date information. 
Optional additional data can be extracted including confidential survey telemetry data, however this is dependant on outside sources. 

A detailed step vignette is provides to step through the process using a test dataset provided as part of the package. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of skmoose from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gcperk/skmoose")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(skmoose)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
