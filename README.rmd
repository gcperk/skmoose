# skmoose

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

SKmoose package which provides a series of steps to estimate moose habitat quality within given survey blocks. This package was written for the Skeena Regional Moose survey group under Ministry of Water, Lands & Resources Stewardship. 

Where possible, data used in the process is extracted directly from the BC data catalogue, using bcdata and bcmaps R packages. These ensure up to date information. 

Optional additional data can be extracted including confidential survey telemetry data, however this is dependant on outside sources. 

Two vignettes are provided as a guide for users. These include a detailed version which steps through each part of the process and an abreviated version. A test dataset is provided within the package to assist with understsnding the process. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of skmoose from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gcperk/skmoose")
```

## Overview

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(skmoose)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
