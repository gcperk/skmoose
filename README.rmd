# skmoose

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

SKmoose package which provides a series of steps to estimate moose habitat quality within given survey blocks. This package was written for the Skeena Regional Moose survey group under Ministry of Water, Lands & Resources Stewardship. 

Where possible, data used in the process is extracted directly from the BC data catalogue, using bcdata and bcmaps R packages. These ensure up to date information. 

Optional additional data can be extracted including confidential survey telemetry data, however this is dependant on outside sources. 

Two vignettes are provided as a guide for users. These include a detailed version which steps through each part of the process and an abreviated version. A test dataset is provided within the package to assist with understsnding the process. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of skmoose from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gcperk/skmoose")
```

## Overview

Moose Habitat is estimated for each survey block based on a series of criteria to identify possible moose habitat and remove uninhabitable areas. The spatial data is assembled per survey block rather than the entire extent of the given study area to improve efficient of processing. Appendinces A provides a full list of references and spatial querys for each criteria. 

# Estimate Uninhabiable Moose areas

Uninhabitable areas within the landscape are defined under the following criteria 

- Waterbodies > 1km2

- Elevation > 1500 m 

- Slope > 55 degrees 



# Estimate Moose Habitat 






# Calculate areas


# output table for analysis 


A detailed table of criteria is provided below. 





This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(skmoose)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
